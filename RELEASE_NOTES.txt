Version: 		1.0.0 
Release date:	11.12.2014
--------------------------

The first stable release, which provides a builder, which allows to create dialogs, which are 
designed according to Android 5.0's Material Design guidelines even on pre-Lollipop devices. 
The implementation initially provides the following features:
	
    -   The builder is extended from the Android SDK's built-in class 
        android.app.AlertDialog.Builder and therefore provides all functionalities of its
        base class, including the possibilities to create dialogs with a title, icon, message, 
        up to three buttons and optional list items. 
        
    -   The library uses the AppCompat v7 revision 21 support library in order to retrieve the
        color of a dialog's title and button texts from the applied theme. Alternatively, these
        colors can be set manually using the builder.
        
    -   A dialog's title and content can be replaced by any custom view.
        
    -   The builder supports to create dialogs, whose buttons are stacked, as introduces in the 
        Material Design guidelines.
